As artificial intelligence and machine learning gain more populartity in the tech world, its controversial shortcomings continue to be dismissed -- not because they are benign, but because they would require us to revisit a history that is so actively avoided in fear of discomfort. Although machines' capabilities continue to grow faster than most can comprehend, the foundation for these innovative features remain the same. This rotten base will likely continue to serve as the root of this revolutionary tree until it tips over from the weight of its bearings, unless its flaws are properly and directly addressed.

The very essence of instilling (pseudo)intelligence and autonomy in computers depends on training it with data compiled by generations of human activity.  Contrary to the plot of most apocalyptic robot movies, computers lack the gift of consciousness and originality. That is to say, a program may create original content, but its ability to is entirely a reflection of the education it has received. The manipulative questions and answers provided are all proposed and set by humans. A machine cannot fight against the discrimnation it propels because that is our job, as its creators, teachers, and the culprits responsible for such consequences. After all, a machine doesn't know better -- but we do.
